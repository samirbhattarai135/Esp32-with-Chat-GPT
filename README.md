# Esp32 with Chat-GPT
 
This project leverages the capabilities of the ESP32 microcontroller to connect to the OpenAI Text-to-Speech (TTS) API, convert text input into speech, and stream the audio to a connected Bluetooth speaker. Additionally, the project includes a web server that allows users to download the generated audio as an MP3 file directly from the ESP32.
